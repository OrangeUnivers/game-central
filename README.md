# GameCentral
A collection of games to play when bored.
These games are only linked to and not actually copied.
All ads come from the game itself, not the website.
I'm not making any money on this.

Currently two languages are supported: English, German.
There is currently no way to access the german version.

It also has an normally inaccessable dark mode activated by the command `changeColorScheme()`.

I am tired and want to go to sleep.
I guess you could try to make an **Issue** if you want a new game added, don't know how **Issues** work though.
